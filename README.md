# SF Planning Impact Fee Calculator

(Under Development)

See the calculator in action [here](https://sfcpc.github.io/ifc/).

To run locally, (from the project root directory) run (requires Python):

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The impact fee calculator will then be running at http://localhost:8000/
